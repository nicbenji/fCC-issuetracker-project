https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/issue-tracker

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://issue-tracker.freecodecamp.rocks/. 

    Complete the necessary routes in /routes/api.js
    Create all of the functional tests in tests/2_functional-tests.js
    Copy the sample.env file to .env and set the variables appropriately
    To run the tests automatically, add NODE_ENV=test in your .env file
    To run the tests in the console, use the command npm run test

Write the following tests in tests/2_functional-tests.js:

    Create an issue with every field: POST request to /api/issues/{project}
    Create an issue with only required fields: POST request to /api/issues/{project}
    Create an issue with missing required fields: POST request to /api/issues/{project}
    View issues on a project: GET request to /api/issues/{project}
    View issues on a project with one filter: GET request to /api/issues/{project}
    View issues on a project with multiple filters: GET request to /api/issues/{project}
    Update one field on an issue: PUT request to /api/issues/{project}
    Update multiple fields on an issue: PUT request to /api/issues/{project}
    Update an issue with missing _id: PUT request to /api/issues/{project}
    Update an issue with no fields to update: PUT request to /api/issues/{project}
    Update an issue with an invalid _id: PUT request to /api/issues/{project}
    Delete an issue: DELETE request to /api/issues/{project}
    Delete an issue with an invalid _id: DELETE request to /api/issues/{project}
    Delete an issue with missing _id: DELETE request to /api/issues/{project}
